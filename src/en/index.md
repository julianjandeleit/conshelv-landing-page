        paragraphs: 
         - <b>Physical items</b> normally get stored inside a cabinet or <em>shelf</em>. When an object is desired, one goes to the storage, opens the door if necessary, looks for the item and grabs it from the cabinet. The item can now be used as wished. After usage it gets placed back to the shelf so it can be found again at the correct place.
         - For <b>digital objects</b> and especially photos, the above is not applicable. Photos stored on a pc can only be accessed from the computer itself. Hard drives need to be inserted before usage, only to present the dry file system interface. Such interface does not represent the humans mental model for photo storage, as it contains relationships and types of images not representable in a hierarchical file system. Furthermore, in today's interconnected world, everybody has multiple devices. When intuitive deposit and retrieval is required, keeping a photo collection accessible on every device is next to impossible  with legacy methods.
         - <b>Shelv.</b> represents a cabinet for digital images. With minimal setup, an owner of a Shelv. can connect to its intuitive user interface. When loading images into the device, typical attributes of images such as date, camera and photographer get extracted from the image. Additional categorization like creating albums and custom tags also is supported. Using this information, images on a Shelv. can quickly be found and retrieved. While the user interface is provided on the web, native integration into devices as apps as well as popular file-sharing protocols are also going to be supported.
