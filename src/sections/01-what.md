title: "What is a <em>Shelv.</em>"
---
A _Shelv._ is a device for your home, it has the size of a small box.
At first sight, a _Shelv._ may seem like just another hard-drive to store your data. However, this does not capture the essence of a _Shelv._:

<ul class="list list-disc list-inside">

 <li>Connected: Archived photos can be accessed easily from every device.</li>
 <li>Local: Data is stored in a device you own. This makes privacy concerns superflous.</li>
 <li>Easy To Use: No technical setup necessary.</li>
 <li>Domain-Centric: Don't bother organizing files on a computer. Images are treated as the entities they really are - photos. We believe you should be able to organize them as such!</li>
 <li>much more to discover...</li>

</ul>
Using the properties described above, interacting with digital photos feels like having analog pictures laying on a physical shelf.
